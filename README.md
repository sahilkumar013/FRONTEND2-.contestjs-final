# Student-Management-System

The code provided is an implementation of a student information management system that allows the user to add, edit, and delete student information. 
The student information is stored in an array called students, and the array is also stored in the local storage using localStorage.setItem("students", JSON.stringify(students));.

The addStudent function is responsible for adding the student to the students array and storing the updated array in local storage. 
The showTable function is responsible for rendering the students array in a table. The edit and del functions are responsible for editing and deleting a student record, respectively.

The search function is responsible for searching the student records based on the input provided by the user in the search bar.

Overall, the code is a good implementation of a simple student information management system. 
However, there is room for improvement, such as adding form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled, improving the search function to search for the input in all fields, and making the code more modular by breaking it down into smaller functions.
